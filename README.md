# Weather App

In this project, I utilize a free weather API to fetch and render all the necessary data on the DOM. To make data requests, I employ the Fetch API and utilize Async/Await for asynchronous operations.

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Run "npm install" to install the required dependencies.
Use "npm run dev" to start the project locally.
